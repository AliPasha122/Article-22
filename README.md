Household food waste presents a significant challenge, contributing to environmental
degradation and economic losses. This research proposes a Smart Household Food
Management System (SHFMS) that integrates Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) to monitor, manage, and reduce food waste at the consumer level. The
system comprises smart storage solutions, a centralized management hub, and AI-driven
applications for meal planning and inventory tracking. By providing real-time data and
actionable insights, the SHFMS aims to promote sustainable consumption practices and
enhance household food management efficiency.
